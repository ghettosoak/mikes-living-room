# Mike's VLC NEEO Script
This is a driver for the NEEO SDK to control VLC with your NEEO Remote. It assumes you have a keyboard and a mouse for your computer. 

## Prerequisite
 You must have at least Node.js v6 installed, see http://nodejs.org
 
## Howto
The NEEO controlpad maps as follows:
* left / right: scrub forward / backwards 5sec
* up / ok: play / pause
* down: stop

All other functions can be found in the 'shortcuts' menu. They are:
* TOGGLE FULLSCREEN
* SWITCH TO VLC
* TURN OFF SUBTITLES
