# Mike's YouTube NEEO Script
This is a driver for the NEEO SDK to control YouTube with your NEEO Remote. It assumes you have a keyboard and a mouse for your computer, and that you're running Chrome. I like to open up a series of videos with the keyboard / mouse, and then kick back with the remote in hand.

## Prerequisite
 You must have at least Node.js v6 installed, see http://nodejs.org
 
## Howto
The NEEO controlpad maps as follows:
* up / down: control speed of video
* left / right: scrub forward / backwards 5sec
* ok: play / pause

All other functions can be found in the 'shortcuts' menu. They are:
* FULLSCREEN
* SWITCH TO CHROME
* CLOSE TAB
* (switch to) TAB LEFT
* (switch to) TAB RIGHT
* STOP AUTOPLAY
* RESTART VIDEO
* NEXT VIDEO (next in playlist, or 'up next')
