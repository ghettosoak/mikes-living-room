# Mike's OSX System NEEO Script
This is a driver for the NEEO SDK to control your OSX computer with your NEEO Remote.

## Prerequisite
 You must have at least Node.js v6 installed, see http://nodejs.org
 
## Howto
All functions can be found in the 'shortcuts' menu. They are:
* START SCREENSAVER
* STOP SCREENSAVER
* SYSTEM SHUTDOWN (this also kills VLC, it sometimes hangs for me)
